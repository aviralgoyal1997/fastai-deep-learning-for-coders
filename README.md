<br>This course is all about coding,we already have all codes for each chapter we just need to go to crestle.com and run each of them along with watching video.</br>
<br>When we need these codes for our projects,instead of writing all code we can use fastai library for fast process,we just need to make small changes to code.
<br>To download fastai library <href>https://codeload.github.com/fastai/fastai/tar.gz/0.6</br>
